0:01 Before we get to the actual code examples,
0:02 let's really quickly talk about setup, tools, versions, that sort of thing.
0:06 So, this course is built with Python 3 in mind.
0:10 If you don't have Python 3 installed,
0:12 you can get it for your operating system at python.org/downloads,
0:15 or you can "Homebrew" or "apt get install" it.
0:17 That said, most of the topics will actually be quite similar
0:21 between Python 2 and Python 3,
0:23 so we'll talk about Python 2 whenever there are significant differences.
0:26 You may be wondering why are we talking about Python 3,
0:29 when Python 2 is more widely used today in commercial applications.
0:33 Let's look at Python over time and I think you'll see why I made this decision;
0:38 if we start at the beginning, back in 1989, Guido started work on Python.
0:43 1991, Python 1 came out, 2000 Python 2,
0:47 and then, in 2008 Python 3 came out,
0:50 and this was the first major breaking change
0:52 to try to improve and clean up the language
0:55 from all the years that had preceded it.
0:57 Well, there was limited adoption because people already had large working code basis,
1:02 a lot of the PyPi packages were not updated and so on,
1:05 now if we look at today Python 3 has default as much more common
1:08 than it has been but more importantly,
1:11 if you look just four years into the future, not far at all,
1:14 you will see that Python 2 is "end of life",
1:17 there will be no more support for Python 2 in less than four years.
1:20 And that means, whoever has projects, written in Python 2
1:23 have to not just start upgrading them,
1:26 but complete the upgrades by then.
1:28 So I expect there to be quite a pick up for Python 3
1:31 and I think focusing on Python  3 is very important going forward.
1:35 Guido Van Rossum and the core developers feel this way as well,
1:39 if you look at the last three keynotes,
1:41 there has been something like this
1:43 where Guido has gotten up at PyCon and said,
1:46 "There is not going to be another version of Python 2,
1:49 going forward it's all about Python 3."
1:51 So, that's why this course itself is based on Python 3,
1:54 even though like I said,
1:55 differences are quite minor for the topics we are covering.
