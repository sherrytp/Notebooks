0:01 So I hope that you've saved the source code from this class,
0:03 you can see at "github.com/mikeckenendy/write-pythonic-code-demos",
0:08 we have all the code you saw me write during all the videos,
0:12 so please take this moment, go over there and star that repository,
0:15 maybe fork it, maybe download it, or at least bookmark it in your browser
0:19 so that you can come back to it,
0:21 it should be here forever but you never know, right.
0:23 Also, I want to encourage you to play with these ideas,
0:26 and if having the source code to start from
0:28 helps you play with those ideas in your own code, in your own project,
0:30 then please do so.
