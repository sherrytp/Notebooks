It's  main feature is the pipe operator which is depicted by `%>%` .\n\nThe `magrittr` library makes it easier to see the flow of data as results pass from one function to the next. \n\nYou can read more about the `magrittr` library in this [data lab notebook.](https://bentley.cloud.databricks.com/#notebook/91353)"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Pipe operator\n\nIt is particularly useful when using the [dplyr package](https://bentley.cloud.databricks.com/#notebook/91549/command/91550)."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The easiest way to use and understand the pipe operator is:\n- The result of the command to the left of the pipe operator `%>%` is sent to the first parameter of the command to the right of the pipe. \n\nIn addition, \n- Almost any period in the command on the right of the pipe operator `%>%` is replaced with the result of the command on the left (of the operator.)\n\nFor example,"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%r\nrep(\"hello\", 2)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Please note that before using the pipe operator you will have to load the magrittr package."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%r\nlibrary(magrittr)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%r\n\"hello\" %>%\n  rep(., 2)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%r\n3 %>%\n  rep(\"hello\", .)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%r\n\"hello\" %>% c(., \"goodbye\", ., \"goodbye\")"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%r\nc(3,1,2) %>% sum(., c(4,5,6))"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["There is a shortcut to use when the position on the right side (to place the result from the left side) is the first parameter. \n\nIn this case you can omit the period and the first parameter. \n\nFor example,"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%r\n\"hello\" %>%\n  rep(., 2)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":14},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%r\n\"hello\" %>%\n  rep(2)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%r\n\"hello\" %>%\n  print()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Consider the following command with and without the use of the pipe operator.
